SpringBoot&amp;AngularJS-Demo

The springboot application (demo) does not need a Tomcat server. You should be able to use spring boot to run it from intellij or eclipse. 
For the sake of the tutorial "YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE SPRING TOOL SUITE INSTALLED". There is limited time for the demo, so I will jump right
into the code.

The AngularJS app should also be able to run from your command line using "npm start" provide you have node, npm and Angular 2 installed.
I also recommend having a MySQL community server edition installed. The server can be configure to any database of your choosing, but I will
be using MySQL in the demo.

The goal is for you to walk away with a template you can build on and tweak for future projects. Looking forward to seeing you folks on the 6th.
